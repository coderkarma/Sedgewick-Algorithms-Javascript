# Sedgewick Algorithms in Javascript

These are my implementations of Sedgewick's Algorithm's book. I have been reading this book in order to improve my knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms, as well as improve my understanding of Unit Testing and ES6.

Please don't comment asking about why I did these in javascript - I want to expand my knowledge in the language and also improve my algorithmic skills at the same time. I also considered doing this in Ruby, C, or Go, but I chose to focus on Javascript because it's more fun.
